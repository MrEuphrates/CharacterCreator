USE THIS DOCUMENT TO RECORD WHAT YOU LAST DID AND WHERE YOU LEFT OFF RE: WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

10/30/17 REH
I had to redo the stuff I did on Saturday because it was lost when I reverted to the wrong commit.

10/28/17 REH
Abilities are now saving to the character sheet and sorting into the appropriate list boxes. Next I need to allow users to edit existing abilities, make sure they
are resorted appropriately, and I need to work on saving and loading characters (which will aid in my testing, too).

10/27/17 REH
Left off with abilities evaluating bonus damage based on the special rules, tying the ability to the appropriate stat.

10/26/17 REH
Added output of the syntax to the ability form.  Modified to update and display the ability with the "requires input" feature, flagging and labeling abilities that will require more input from me.
Not sure what to work on next.  Ability form might be done, may be time to have it pulled back to the character sheet.

When I left off about 220pm, I decided that I need to rework energy calc in this tool, because I implemented it using percentages of the base damage, but really, I should be using the rules as written,
and therefore using energy modifiers instead.  So I need to implement that, including a display on the Ability form so the user knows what the modifier is, currently.

When I left off with this, I had finished testing rule validation on SpecialForm.  I think updating the Ability and passing it back to the Ability is next, followed by
adding more rules to an ability which already has some, and editing and deleting existing rules, too.

When I finished this night, I had implemented incompatability methods and properties for the special rules and made them appear on the information form; however, 
I have barely tested any of them.
