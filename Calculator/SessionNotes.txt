I reworked energy calcs to use energy modifiers.  Tested.

When I left off about 220pm, I decided that I need to rework energy calc in this tool, because I implemented it using percentages of the base damage, but really, I should be using the rules as written,
and therefore using energy modifiers instead.  So I need to implement that, including a display on the Ability form so the user knows what the modifier is, currently.

When I left off with this, I had finished testing rule validation on SpecialForm.  I think updating the Ability and passing it back to the Ability is next, followed by
adding more rules to an ability which already has some, and editing and deleting existing rules, too.

When I finished this night, I had implemented incompatability methods and properties for the special rules and made them appear on the information form; however, 
I have barely tested any of them.
