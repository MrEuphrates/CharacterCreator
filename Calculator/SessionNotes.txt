It seems I need to thoroughly test the parameters for every special rule, as a random test of ChangeSpeed bombed.  Sorted it out.

When I left off with this, I had finished testing rule validation on SpecialForm.  I think updating the Ability and passing it back to the Ability is next, followed by
adding more rules to an ability which already has some, and editing and deleting existing rules, too.

When I finished this night, I had implemented incompatability methods and properties for the special rules and made them appear on the information form; however, 
I have barely tested any of them.
