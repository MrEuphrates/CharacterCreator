Stopped about 140pm.  May work on more today.  Left off with ParameterForm.  Have fair bit of work to do on the interface and inputting data, but made good progress on it.

When I finished this night, I had implemented incompatability methods and properties for the special rules and made them appear on the information form; however, 
I have barely tested any of them.
